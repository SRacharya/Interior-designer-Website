    2. <span>Space Planning</span>: I can create a layout and floor plan for the space, considering factors such as traffic flow, furniture placement, and functionality. This involves maximizing the use of available space and ensuring efficient utilization of the area. <br><br>
    
    3. <span>Concept Development</span>: Based on the client's preferences and requirements, I can develop a design concept that includes color schemes, material selection, lighting plans, and overall ambiance. This stage involves creating a cohesive and visually appealing design scheme. <br><br>

    4. <span>Material and Finishes Selection</span> : I can assist clients in choosing suitable materials, finishes, furnishings, and fixtures for their space. This includes selecting items such as flooring, wall coverings, paint colors, furniture, lighting fixtures, and window treatments. <br><br>

This ensures that the furniture integrates seamlessly with the overall design and maximizes functionality. <br><br>
